            <p>Scout Labs is a project I founded and currently lead within Scout, Northeastern University's student-led design studio. Scout Labs is a social innovation initiative that uses human-centered, inclusive design to tackle social issues. Our interdisciplinary team(with specialties in design, computer science, and social enterprise) identifies a social issue that is locally focused, yet relevant on a broader scale, and goes through the design thinking process to create a meaningful solution. This project is something that I am incredibly passionate about and is representative of the work I want to do in the future.</p> 
            <p>Scout Labs is currently going through its first year-long project. At the beginning of the academic year we began to do background research and identify areas that we believed could be potential project topics. We deep dove into education, the achievement gap, food access, transportation and carbon emissions, and much more. After reaching out to various academic and field experts, we decided to focus on promoting healthy food behavior in low income communities.</p>
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>To gain a more complete understanding of this topic, we conducted field research at grocery stores in our target neighborhood, talked to professors with expertise, and reached out to groups working in this space. We gathered an enormous amount of information and began to make sense of it to define our own point of view. We created insight statements that represented our research and would inform our ideation process. Here are a few of our insights:</p>
            <p style="font-weight:700; color:#404040; font-style:italic;">"Poor food decisions are happening across socioeconomic groups, but especially affect low socioeconomic groups because of other external factors, such as time and money constraints."</p>
            <p style="font-weight:700; color:#404040; font-style:italic;">"Local bodegas act as community space. Even though local stores are generally less healthy and more expensive than larger grocery stores, they are used by the community, especially children for afterschool snacks."</p>
            <p style="font-weight:700; color:#404040; font-style:italic;">"People that cook regularly have a level of confidence that makes cooking easier and less stressful than for someone who does not cook regularly."</p>
            <p style="font-weight:700; color:#404040; font-style:italic;">"People supplement large grocery shopping trips with smaller trips."</p>

            <h2>Ideation</h2>
            <p>We decided that an intervention at the point of purchase was both feasible and valuable. We know that when making food purchases, people are effected by much more than rational thought. Visceral factors such as hunger and visual cues can easily sway the decisions being made. We believe that if we can alter the shopping experience in some way to nudge a person to make healthier choices, we can have a significant impact. While ideating and prototyping possible solutions, we looked into creating a new shopping cart, designing signage and labeling for local bodegas, and gamifying the shopping experience.</p>

            </div>
            <h2>Design, Prototyping, and Testing</h2> 
            <p>We decided to design a program that would use signage and positioning to promote the purchase of produce in community corner stores. By partnering with the corner store owners, we will create displays to be placed in a prominent location in the store. This display would feature an "ingredient of the week," so to speak, that could be picked up at the location. In addition to the ingredient, the display would provide recipe cards so that customers have the information to make easy, delicious meals. The recipe cards will only feature basic ingredients, or ingredients that can be found in the corner store. To implement this, we will need to first work with the owners to determine what is feasible for them to implement. We do not want to be a burden on them. Second, we are going to conduct research amongst the corner store customers to determine what foods will be attractive and most successful.</p>
            <p>As we implement this program, we will be tracking sales from the corner stores and following up with participants in the program to be able to measure any impact.</p>
