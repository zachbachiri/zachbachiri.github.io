            <p>Scout Labs is a project I created and currently lead within Scout, Northeastern University's student-run design studio. Scout Labs is a social innovation initiative that uses human-centered, inclusive design to solve social issues. Our interdisciplinary team(with specialties in design, computer science, and social enterprise) identifies a social issue that is locally focus, yet relevant on a broader scale, and goes through the design thinking process to create meaningful solutions. This project is something that I am incredibly passionate about and is representative of what I want to be doing in the future.</p> 
            <p>Scout Labs is currently going through its first year-long project. At the beginning of the academic year we began to do background research and identify area that we believed could be potential project topics. We deep dove into education and the achievement gap, food access, transportation carbon emissions, and many more. After reaching out to various academic and field experts, we decided to focus on promoting healthy food behavior in low income communities. </p>

            <p>To gain a more complete understanding of this topic, we conducted field research at local groceries stores, talked to academics that focus in this area, and reached out to groups that are already working in this space. We gathered an enormous amount of information and began to make sense of it to define our own point of view.</p>
            <p>We made the decision to attempt an intervention at the point of purchase. We know that when making food purchases, people are effected by much more than rational thought. Visceral factors such as hunger and visual cues can easily sway the decisions being made. We believe that if we can alter the shopping experience in some way to nudge a person to make healthier choices, we can have a significant impact. As we continue with this project throughout the rest of the year, we are ideating and prototyping some possible solutions. We have looked into creating a new shopping cart, designing signing and labeling for local bodegas and corner stores, and gamifying the shopping experience. </p>
