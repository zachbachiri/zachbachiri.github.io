            <p>Scout Labs is a project I created and currently lead within Scout, Northeastern University's student-run design studio. Scout Labs is a social innovation initiative that uses human-centered, inclusive design to solve social issues. Our interdisciplinary team(with specialties in design, computer science, and social enterprise) identifies a social issue that is locally focused, yet relevant on a broader scale, and goes through the design thinking process to create a meaningful solution. This project is something that I am incredibly passionate about and is representative of what I want to be doing in the future.</p> 
            <p>Scout Labs is currently going through its first year-long project. At the beginning of the academic year we began to do background research and identify areas that we believed could be potential project topics. We deep dove into education and the achievement gap, food access, transportation and carbon emissions, and many more. After reaching out to various academic and field experts, we decided to focus on promoting healthy food behavior in low income communities.</p>

            <p>To gain a more complete understanding of this topic, we conducted field research at local groceries stores, talked to academics that focus on this subject, and reached out to groups that are working in this space. We gathered an enormous amount of information and began to make sense of it to define our own point of view. We created insight statements that represented our research and would inform our ideation process. Here are a few of our insights:</p>
            <p style="font-weight:700;">"Poor food decisions are happening across socioeconomic groups, but especially affect low socioeconomic groups because of other external factors, such as time and money constraints."</p>
            <p style="font-weight:700;">"Local bodegas act as community space. Even though local stores are generally less healthy and more expensive than larger grocery stores, they are used by the community, especially children for afterschool snacks."</p>
            <p style="font-weight:700;">"People that cook regularly have a level of confidence that makes cooking easier and less stressful than for someone who does not cook regularly."</p>
            <p style="font-weight:700;">"People supplement large grocery shopping trips with smaller trips."</p>
            <p>We made the decision an intervention at the point of purchase was both feasible and valuable. We know that when making food purchases, people are effected by much more than rational thought. Visceral factors such as hunger and visual cues can easily sway the decisions being made. We believe that if we can alter the shopping experience in some way to nudge a person to make healthier choices, we can have a significant impact. As we continue with this project throughout the rest of the year, we are ideating and prototyping possible solutions. We have looked into creating a new shopping cart, designing signage and labeling for local bodegas, and gamifying the shopping experience.</p>
