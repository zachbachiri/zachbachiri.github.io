                <p>Naya is a social networking platform for incoming students that leverages AI to facilitate bidirectional learning through person to person conversation.</p>

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p><span style="font-style: italic;">“Although I am well-traveled and I expected to know more about the US, I just get surprised every time a new thing is thrown at me, and I go quiet because I don’t know how to react.”</span> -<span style="font-weight: 600;">CMU International Student</span></p>

                <p>Each year, there 1.18 million international students in the United States. Many of them go through a process acclimation that can be, at times, stressful and overwhelming.</p>

                <p>During our M.Des. Studio 2, which attempted to explore the connection between artificial intelligence and learning, we attempted to design a solution that would create a more inclusive environment for international students on campus. We framed out design challenge as follows:</p>

                <div class="portfolio_image full">
                    <a href="portfolio/naya1.png" target="_blank"><img alt="How might we use artificial intelligence to aid cultural learning for international students arriving in the United States?" style="border:none;" src="portfolio/naya1.png"></a>
                </div>

                <h2>Exploratory Research</h2>
                <p>We began by conducting exploratory research with international students on campus to better understand what pain points they encountered and how they overcame them when first arriving to the US. We used a variety of research methods to get at these questions. Methods like interviews, surveys, journey mapping, storyboarding, and letter writing were leveraged.</p>

                <div class="portfolio_image half">
                    <a href="portfolio/naya2.JPG" target="_blank"><img style="border:none;" src="portfolio/naya2.JPG"></a>
                    <span class="caption">exploratory research session</span>
                </div>
                <div class="portfolio_image half">
                    <a href="portfolio/naya4.gif" target="_blank"><img style="border: 1px solid black;" src="portfolio/naya4.gif"></a>
                    <span class="caption">journey maps</span>
                </div>
               
                <p>Through this research we discovered some initial insights that guided us moving forward:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>People mostly rely on social interaction as a way of learning and adapting to a new culture.</li>
                    <li>People can’t prepare for every situation. Sometimes they need help in the moment of an interaction.</li>
                    <li>Community and a social network are an important means for learning about and adjusting to a new culture.</li>
                    <li>Language exacerbates a lot of other barriers immigrants face.</li>
                    <li>Resources for immigrants are fragmented and hard to find.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Generative Research</h2>
                <p>After our exploratory research, we began generative research with the goal of sparking ideas and concepts around how international students can overcome the various hurdles we heard about earlier.</p>

                <div class="portfolio_image full">
                    <a href="portfolio/naya5.png" target="_blank"><img style="border:none;" src="portfolio/naya5.png"></a>
                </div>

                <p>We held a two part participatory design sessions in which we identified the most common problematic scenarios international students come up against and then generated solutions to those scenarios. With these solutions we were not looking for 1-to-1 solutions, but rather looking for themes that emerged which would inform our final design.</p>

                <div class="portfolio_image third">
                    <a href="portfolio/naya6.JPG" target="_blank"><img style="border:none;" src="portfolio/naya6.JPG"></a>
                    <span class="caption">scenario building workshop</span>
                </div>
                <div class="portfolio_image third">
                    <a href="portfolio/naya7.JPG" target="_blank"><img style="border: none;" src="portfolio/naya7.JPG"></a>
                    <span class="caption">solution building workshop</span>
                </div>
                <div class="portfolio_image third">
                    <a href="portfolio/naya8.JPG" target="_blank"><img style="border: none;" src="portfolio/naya8.JPG"></a>
                    <span class="caption">design generated by workshop participants</span>
                </div>

                <p>We generated the following insights through participatory design workshop:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A bi-directional cultural learning process makes the acclimation process for immigrants easier and more effective than unidirectional approach.</li>
                    <li>International students try to avoid unfamiliar situations they anticipate to be difficult, and will go out of their way to do so.</li>
                    <li>Having a supportive community is important to the mental and emotional wellbeing of international students.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>We then developed 3 concept directions to speed date with international students.</p>

                <div class="portfolio_image full">
                    <a href="portfolio/naya11.png" target="_blank"><img style="border:none;" src="portfolio/naya11.png"></a>
                </div>
                <div class="portfolio_image half">
                    <a href="portfolio/naya10.png" target="_blank"><img style="border: none;" src="portfolio/naya10.png"></a>
                </div>
                <div class="portfolio_image half">
                    <a href="portfolio/naya9.png" target="_blank"><img style="border: none;" src="portfolio/naya9.png"></a>
                </div>

                <p>We received positive feedback about the social network with facilitated interaction and decided to move forward with this concept. There were a few reasons for this. First, and most importantly, a network would allow for us to organically create bi-directional learning between international and American students. Second, this platform created an incentive for both international and American students to join. And finally, by creating an intervention before students arrive on campus, we are able to create a more welcoming environment before students even arrive in the US.</p>

                <h2>Concept Development</h2>
                <p>With our concept direction set, we began formalizing the user journey and creating wireframes to test with users.</p>
                <div class="portfolio_image fourth">
                    <a href="portfolio/naya20.png" target="_blank"><img style="border:none;" src="portfolio/naya20.png"></a>
                    <span class="caption">home</span>
                </div>
                <div class="portfolio_image fourth">
                    <a href="portfolio/naya21.png" target="_blank"><img style="border:none;" src="portfolio/naya21.png"></a>
                    <span class="caption">groups</span>
                </div>
                <div class="portfolio_image fourth">
                    <a href="portfolio/naya22.png" target="_blank"><img style="border:none;" src="portfolio/naya22.png"></a>
                    <span class="caption">assistant</span>
                </div>
                <div class="portfolio_image fourth">
                    <a href="portfolio/naya23.png" target="_blank"><img style="border:none;" src="portfolio/naya23.png"></a>
                    <span class="caption">profile + settings</span>
                </div>

                <p>We set out to first test the bot intervention and student matching, since those were the key implementations of artificial intelligence on the platform.</p>
                <div class="portfolio_image full">
                    <a href="portfolio/naya25.png" target="_blank"><img style="border:none;" src="portfolio/naya25.png"></a>
                    <span class="caption">chat intervention iterations for testing</span>
                </div>
                <div class="portfolio_image full">
                    <a href="portfolio/naya26.png" target="_blank"><img style="border:none;" src="portfolio/naya26.png"></a>
                    <span class="caption">matching iterations for testing</span>
                </div>

                <p>The feedback we received testing these features was vital in iterating on and finalizing our design. </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>People didn't like when the bot made assumptions about them or put words into their mouth.</li>
                    <li>People liked having multiple options provided to them.</li>
                    <li>People preferred having more information about their matches, but were actually okay with having anonymized matches. Some saw the value in not knowing who you are matching with.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 50px;">Conversation Analysis</h3>
                <p>To better understand how the facilitation bot would function during a conversation, we also conducted conversation analysis on conversations that we setup between incoming CMU Design students. We printed out these conversations and noted points of breakdown or missed opportunity. </p>
                <div class="portfolio_image full">
                    <a href="portfolio/naya24.png" target="_blank"><img style="border:none;" src="portfolio/naya24.png"></a>
                    <span class="caption">conversation analysis</span>
                </div>

                <p>We discovered that breakdowns didn’t happen as often as expected, but there were lots of opportunities cultural learning that were not capitalized on. That shifted our thinking about the bot from being about fixing breakdowns to proactively creating opportunities for cultural learning as a way of increasing engagement between students.</p>
                

                <h2>Naya Platform</h2>
                <p>The result of all this research and iteration is the Naya platform for incoming students. Naya is a social networking platform for incoming students that leverages AI to facilitate bidirectional learning through person to person conversation. When students enroll at a university, the school will invite each incoming class to join this platform prior to arriving on campus.</p>
                <div class="portfolio_image full">
                    <a href="portfolio/naya12.png" target="_blank"><img style="border:none;" src="portfolio/naya12.png"></a>
                </div>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 50px; color: #5D6BEB;">Onboarding</h3>
                <div class="portfolio_image third" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                    <a href="portfolio/naya14.gif" target="_blank"><img style="border:none;" src="portfolio/naya14.gif"></a>
                </div>
                <p>The Naya onboarding experience creates expectancy of a positive social experience and cultural learning with their classmates. It is also an opportunity for students to indicate interests that will later be used to match with other students and make recommendations.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 50px; color: #5D6BEB;">Naya Bot</h3>
                <div class="portfolio_image third" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                    <a href="portfolio/naya15.gif" target="_blank"><img style="border: none;" src="portfolio/naya15.gif"></a>
                </div>
                <p>The goal of Naya bot is to provide a unified resource for students to access needed information. Most logistical resources students need are not best acquired through conversation and we heard in research about the many disparate resources that are difficult to find. This addresses that fragmentation.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 50px; color: #5D6BEB;">Matching</h3>
                <div class="portfolio_image third" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                    <a href="portfolio/naya19.gif" target="_blank"><img style="border: none;" src="portfolio/naya19.gif"></a>
                </div>
                <p>Matching remove implicit bias in connections on the Naya platform and initiates relationships between international and American students. Through a nameless and faceless matching system, students connect based on their interests.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 50px; color: #5D6BEB;">Chat With Facilitation Bot</h3>
                <div class="portfolio_image third" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                    <a href="portfolio/naya16.gif" target="_blank"><img style="border: none;" src="portfolio/naya16.gif"></a>
                </div>
                <div class="portfolio_image third" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                    <a href="portfolio/naya17.gif" target="_blank"><img style="border:none;" src="portfolio/naya17.gif"></a>
                </div>
                <p>Chat encourages international and American students to talk about topics that foster bidirectional cultural learning. The suggestion functionality recognizes topics of conversation and surfaces topics with prewritten messages that create the opportunity to spark cultural learning through conversation.</p>
                <div class="portfolio_image full" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                    <a href="portfolio/naya13.gif" target="_blank"><img style="border:none;" src="portfolio/naya13.gif"></a>
                </div>
                <p>To make these suggestions, we will need a knowledge graph that draws connections between topics. As students act upon our suggestions, connections in the graph become stronger and suggestions become more confident.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 50px; color: #5D6BEB;">Bookmark</h3>
                <div class="portfolio_image third" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                    <a href="portfolio/naya18.gif" target="_blank"><img style="border: none;" src="portfolio/naya18.gif"></a>
                </div>
                <p>Bookmarking allows users to save and review information to refer back to later. These saved messages are automatically sorted by topic. By doing this, students will be able to create an index of information they can go to when they encounter issues on campus or want to reference back to something that arose in a conversation.</p>
