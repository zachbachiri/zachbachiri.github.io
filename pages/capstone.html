            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>For my senior capstone project at Northeastern University, I constructed a digital interactive art project with 1 classmate. Our goal for this project was to create an interaction that encourages people to experience a familiar space in a new and interesting way. This was accomplished through an interactive art piece in the east staircase of the design building at Northeastern.</p> 

            <h2>Ideation</h2>
            <p>We were intrigued by interactive art and were inspired by the breadth and variety of what we uncovered in our research on the topic. To gain further insight into the process of creating this type of work we met with various artists to discuss their own experiences. We applied these insights to further our research and develop our own idea. To develop these ideas, we considered what actions people perform in public space and how we may alter or enhance those experiences. We began to sketch ideas that would achieve the goals we identified. We wanted something that provided immediate feedback, manipulated the normal usage of the space, and allowed for system discovery. The stairs of the design building at Northeastern provided a particularly fertile ground for creation, due to the volume of human traffic. We decided to create a piece that allowed people to interact with these stairs in a novel way.</p>

            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Our final installation was installed for seven days near the end of the semester. The installation was created with force sensitive resistors running along the length of each step. LED lights were controlled by the resistors on the steps that were perpendicular to the lights. The lights extended upward for 6 feet from the base of the step. Pressure on the resistors (someone stepping on a step) caused a change in the color of the LED light associated with the step. The color changes were dictated by a predefined list of colors. The lights all began with the same color, but as the activity on the stairs became chaotic, so too did the arrangement of colors. The stairs were an ideal location to put an installation because there are periods of time where only one person is on the flight of stairs, and other times when more than ten people may be using them. This allowed for the exploration of how the number of people in a space affects the behavior in that space, and how adding an element of surprise to a normal activity affects human behavior.</p>
